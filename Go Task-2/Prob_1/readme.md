# Problem 1:
```
Generate a random number between 1 and 100
If the number is higher than 50 print "It's closer to 100"
If the number is lower than 50 print "It's closer to 0"
Print the generated random number
```

## Solution : 

* How to run : Type `go run Code_1.go` in your bash terminal
* Time Complexity : N*O(1)
* Space Complexity : O(1) [constant]
* Explanation : Using random function and user-controlled infinite loop
