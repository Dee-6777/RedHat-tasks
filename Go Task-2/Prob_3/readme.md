# Problem
```
Modify the conditional in the code of Prob-2 to check not only if the  number is higher than 50 but also if it's even. If it's even and higher than 50, print,"It's closer to 100 and it's even!"
```

## Solution : 

* How to run : Type `go run Code_1.go` in your bash terminal
* Time Complexity : N*O(1)
* Space Complexity : O(1) [constant]

## Output :
