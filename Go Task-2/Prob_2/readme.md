# Problem 1:
```
Modify Problem-1 to print "It's 50!" if the random number is 50
```

## Solution 1: 

* How to run : Type `go run Code_1.go` in your bash terminal
* Time Complexity : N*O(1)
* Space Complexity : O(1) [constant]
* Used math/rand and user-controlled infinite loop

## Solution 2:

* How to run : Type `go run Code_1.go` in your bash terminal
* Time Complexity : N*O(1)
* Space Complexity : O(1) [constant]
* Used crypto/rand and user-controlled infinite loop

## Output :
