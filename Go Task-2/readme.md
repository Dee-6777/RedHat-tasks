# Problem 1:
```
Generate a random number between 1 and 100
If the number is higher than 50 print "It's closer to 100"
If the number is lower than 50 print "It's closer to 0"
Print the generated random number
```
# Problem 2:
```
Modify Problem-1 to print "It's 50!" if the random number is 50
```
# Problem-3
```
Modify the conditional in the code of Prob-2 to check not only if the  number is higher than 50 but also if it's even. If it's even and higher than 50, print,"It's closer to 100 and it's even!"
```
## Conclusion :

```
After running and comparing all the solutions we came to a conclusion that, as long as the Time Complexity is concerned, the math/rand and crypto/rand almost consumes same amount of time. But we cannot use math/rand in every case because :


Math.random() is implemented using a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). This means that the random number is derived from an internal state, mangled by a deterministic algorithm for every new random  number. 
It seems random to the user because the algorithm is tuned in such a way that it appears so. 
However, if you know the generator's internal state, you know all the future numbers generated by it.

Whereas in crypto/rand implementations don't use a truly random number generator to guarantee enough performance. 
Instead, they use a pseudo-random number generator seeded with a value with enough entropy- that is, unpredictable input - from a source which other people can't observe. 
This ensures there's a good balance between performance and the quality of the randomness generated. Since the seed value is random, the output is cryptographically secure.
